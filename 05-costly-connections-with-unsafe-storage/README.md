# Costly Connections With Unsafe Storage 

Implement a function `sendAndSave(requests []string, maxConn int)` that:

* Manages up to `maxConn` concurrent connections.
* Ensures connections are properly established before sending requests.
* Sends multiple requests using the Send method and saves responses using `UnsafeStorage`.
* Prevents corrupt data storage by ensuring safe handling of `UnsafeStorage.Save`.
* Properly handles locking and concurrency to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
